<h1>Summer Transfer Signings</h1>

<body>
    <h2>Defense positons</h2>
    <h2>Right back and Centre back positions</h2>
    <p> During the back end of last season, Arsenal football club players became fatigued by the numerous games played
        and the lack of squad depth in the team.
        This resulted to them losening a grip on the premier league title to the defending champions Manchester city.
        The centre back position was the most affected area as an injury to William Saliba (best centre back in the
        2022-2023
        season) made Arsenal football club vunrable. More goals were conceded as his replacements,-Rob Holding and Yakub
        Kiwior-were
        unable to rise to the occasion and match his defensive prowess.

    <h3>Mikel Arteta types of players</h3>

    <p>Mikel Arteta, as the manager of Arsenal Football Club is a high profile manager who burst into the footballing
        world during the 2019-2020 season by coaching Arsenal Football club to its 14th FA cup win in their history.
        This was after 6 months of taking charge of Arsenal Football club.<br>
        Currently Manager, Mikel Arteta has been ranked the 4th best manager according to<a
            href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37949635/fc-100-best-men-managers-2022-23"> ESPN rankings</a>.
        Some players
        refer to him as a control freak while others call him a leader and determined manager. <br>

        Here I can provide some insights into the qualities and characteristics he tends to prioritize:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong><em>Tactical Understanding</em></strong>: Arteta values players who can grasp and execute his
            tactical instructions effectively.
            He looks for players who can adapt to different systems, understand positional responsibilities, and
            contribute
            to the team's overall game plan.</li>

        <li><strong><em>Technical Proficiency</em></strong>: Arteta emphasizes technical ability and looks for players
            who are comfortable on the
            ball, possess good passing accuracy, and have strong ball control. This is crucial for the possession-based
            style of play that Arteta often implements.</li>

        <li><strong><em>Work Rate and Discipline</em></strong>: Arteta values players who are hardworking, disciplined,
            and committed to the team's
            objectives. He expects players to press high, track back defensively, and contribute to both attacking and
            defensive phases of play.</li>

        <li><strong><em>Versatility</em></strong>: Arteta prefers players who can play in multiple positions or fulfill
            various roles within the team.
            This flexibility allows him to make tactical adjustments and gives players more opportunities to contribute.
        </li>

        <li><strong><em>Intelligence and Decision Making</em></strong>: Arteta values players with high football
            intelligence who can make quick and
            effective decisions on the field. He looks for players who can read the game well, anticipate situations,
            and
            make the right choices in terms of passing, movement, and positioning.</li>

        <li><em><strong>Leadership</strong></em>: Arttea loves leaders on the pitch an this was visible during the
            aqusition of players like Olexandza Zinchenko, Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Jesus, and Albert Sambi Lokonga. He
            visions if the team is full or leaders , then the mentality of the other players and the club will change
            and become hungry for silverware. This is visible from the 2022-2023 season where Arsenal Football Club
            narrowly missed the Premier league title by 5 points.</li>
